# Data Repository for the Code Comparison


This is the repository of a collaboration of several supernova radiative transfer codes. 
This repository will be updated from time to time. There is a code called plot_XXX that can be used to 
easily make comparison plots with the following instructions.

```bash

./plot_XXX toy01 lbol

```
